  "encode_block() -- the encode-side inverse of av1.decode-block/
   decode-block, for THIS repo's narrow single-keyframe encode scope only
   (2026-07 AV1 encode task, ADR-2607122000 Migration step 9 continuation):
   a single BLOCK_32X32/PARTITION_NONE leaf covering the whole (32x32)
   frame, DC_PRED (luma), TX_32X32/DCT_DCT, luma only (monochrome) --
   scoped even narrower than av1.decode-block's own scope (which also
   supports V_PRED/H_PRED/PAETH_PRED/SMOOTH_PRED, chroma, ADST/TX_4X4, and
   a zero-motion inter-frame extension -- none of which this first encode
   pass produces).

   Every context-derivation helper this needs (get-coeff-base-ctx/
   get-coeff-br-ctx/get-dc-sign-ctx/record-above!/record-left!) is REUSED
   directly from av1.decode-block (made public there for exactly this
   reason -- a visibility-only change, no logic change) rather than
   re-transcribed here: those functions are pure (cdf-context math over an
   already-known coefficient/state map, no bitstream interaction), so
   reusing them structurally GUARANTEES this encoder's context derivation
   can never independently drift from the decoder's -- a real risk if the
   same ~40-line ctx formula were hand-copied a second time.

   `write-coeffs` mirrors av1.decode-block/read-coeffs's own three passes
   (all_zero -> transform_type -> eob -> level pass (c=eob-1 downto 0) ->
   sign+golomb pass (c=0..eob-1)) in the same order, over the SAME target
   `quant` array (already-quantized coefficients in raster position, from
   av1.transform/forward-transform-2d + quantize) -- so every ctx this
   encoder computes mid-write is computed from exactly the same
   partially-filled `quant` state read-coeffs would have decoded UP TO
   that point, guaranteeing the two sides can't desync on context."
