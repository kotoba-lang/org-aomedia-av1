   SCOPE (Phase 1 pixel-reconstruction milestone, ADR-2607122000 Migration
   step 9, continuing av1.tile-group's Phase 0/1 OBU/header/bool-decoder/
   partition-tree work): this is the first phase of this repo that produces
   actual reconstructed pixels, deliberately narrowed the same way
   `org-iso-h264`'s first pixel-reconstruction phase was --

     - the original DC_PRED-only fixtures exercise exactly ONE partition/
       leaf shape end-to-end: a single superblock whose decode_partition()
       walk forces PARTITION_SPLIT down through zero-bit reads (per
       av1.tile-group) until a single real PARTITION_NONE read at
       BLOCK_32X32 produces one leaf covering the entire (32x32, in that
       fixture) frame. The V_PRED/H_PRED mode-coverage fixtures extend this
       to a real MULTI-leaf frame -- a 64x64-pixel, single-64x64-superblock
       frame encoded with `--min-partition-size=32 --max-partition-size=32`
       (forcing the encoder's real, normally-signaled `partition` symbol
       read at the top-level BLOCK_64X64 call to be PARTITION_SPLIT,
       producing exactly 4 BLOCK_32X32 leaves in a 2x2 grid) -- every leaf
       is still exactly BLOCK_32X32/TX_32X32/DCT_DCT (luma). See test/av1/
       decode_block_test.clj / test/av1/fixtures.clj for how each real
       aomenc encode was steered into its exact shape;
     - exactly ONE luma transform size is supported: TX_32X32 (`tx-mode`
       must be `:tx-mode-largest` and the block's Max_Tx_Size_Rect must
       resolve to TX_32X32 -- anything else throws). This isn't an
       arbitrary choice: TX_32X32 is also the one size for which
       get_tx_set() (see `read-transform-type` below) is *structurally*
       forced to TX_SET_DCTONLY (Tx_Size_Sqr_Up[TX_32X32] == TX_32X32,
       spec #Get transform set function), meaning TxType == DCT_DCT is
       guaranteed by the bitstream syntax itself (zero bits read) rather
       than merely likely for smooth content -- the most robust possible
       scope boundary for a phase that explicitly excludes ADST/IDTX/
       FLIPADST;
     - exactly FIVE luma intra prediction modes are supported: DC_PRED,
       V_PRED, H_PRED, PAETH_PRED (added by the PAETH mode-coverage
       extension, ADR-2607122000 Migration step 9 continuation -- see
       av1.intra-pred/paeth-predict), and SMOOTH_PRED (added by the SMOOTH
       mode-coverage extension, same Migration step 9 continuation -- see
       av1.intra-pred/smooth-predict). Every other `intra_frame_y_mode`
       (D45/D135/D113/D157/D203/D67/SMOOTH_V_PRED/SMOOTH_H_PRED) still
       throws (the CDF *read* itself is real and correct for all 13 modes
       -- see `read-y-mode` -- only the *result* is restricted to these
       five). Neither PAETH_PRED nor SMOOTH_PRED is a directional mode
       (is_directional_mode(PAETH_PRED) and is_directional_mode(
       SMOOTH_PRED) are both false; spec 08.decoding.process.md's mode
       dispatch routes PAETH_PRED to the \"basic intra prediction process\"
       7.11.2.2 and SMOOTH_PRED to the \"smooth intra prediction process\"
       7.11.2.6, neither is the directional process 7.11.2.4 that V_PRED/
       H_PRED use) -- so `read-angle-delta-y` already correctly reads NO
       angle_delta_y bit for either a PAETH_PRED or SMOOTH_PRED block (its
       existing `(contains? #{V_PRED H_PRED} y-mode)` gate already excludes
       both, no code change needed there for either extension), and
       SMOOTH_PRED (like PAETH_PRED) needed no edge-filter/upsample/angle
       reasoning at all, unlike the V_PRED/H_PRED extension. `read-y-mode`'s
       neighbor-context lookup (`tables/Intra-Mode-Context`) was already
       widened to the full 13-entry spec table by the PAETH extension, so
       no further widening was needed for SMOOTH_PRED -- `Intra_Mode_Context[
       SMOOTH_PRED(=9)] == 0`, IDENTICAL to `Intra_Mode_Context[DC_PRED(=0)]`
       (and to `Intra_Mode_Context[PAETH_PRED(=12)]`), so a SMOOTH_PRED
       neighbor introduces no new reachable (abovemode,leftmode) ctx pair
       beyond the existing (0,0)-only support either (spot-checked against
       the spec's own table, not assumed -- see av1.tables namespace
       comments). Chroma + PAETH_PRED/SMOOTH_PRED luma is explicitly OUT of
       scope: `read-uv-mode`'s cdf-row table
       (`Default-Uv-Mode-Cfl-Allowed-Cdf-Dc-V-H`) only has the DC/V/H rows
       transcribed, so `read-uv-mode` now throws `ex-info` up front
       (`:reason :unsupported-y-mode-for-uv-mode-ctx`) if the block's YMode
       is ever PAETH_PRED or SMOOTH_PRED and the frame is color, rather than
       letting an out-of-range `nth` crash uncontrolled -- both extensions'
       own validation fixtures are monochrome, so this guard is unexercised
       against real data (documented, not silently assumed safe);
     - CHROMA (Cb/Cr) DECODE, this phase's continuation (ADR-2607122000
       Migration step 9, chroma extension): 4:2:0 only (subsampling_x=1,
       subsampling_y=1). Since this repo's only supported leaf shape is
       BLOCK_32X32 (bw4=bh4=8, never 1), HasChroma (spec #Decode block
       syntax) is always `NumPlanes > 1` unconditionally -- none of the
       bw4==1/bh4==1 subsampled-avail special cases in the spec's HasChroma/
       AvailUChroma/AvailLChroma derivation are ever reachable here, so this
       namespace doesn't implement them (AvailUChroma/AvailLChroma are
       simply AvailU/AvailL). A BLOCK_32X32 luma leaf subsamples (4:2:0) to
       exactly BLOCK_16X16/TX_16X16 chroma (Subsampled_Size[BLOCK_32X32][1][1]
       == BLOCK_16X16, Max_Tx_Size_Rect[BLOCK_16X16] == TX_16X16 -- both
       spot-checked directly against the spec's own tables, see av1.tables
       namespace docstring's chroma section) -- hardcoded rather than
       table-driven for the same reason TX32-W/TX32-BWL were hardcoded for
       luma (this phase supports exactly one shape per plane). Only
       UV_DC_PRED (chroma DC prediction, `uv_mode` decoded value 0) is
       supported -- `read-uv-mode` throws for any other decoded value
       (including UV_CFL_PRED, which would need `read_cfl_alphas()`, out of
       scope) the same way `read-y-mode` restricts luma. `compute_tx_type()`
       for plane>0 is NEVER a bitstream read (`transform_type()` is only
       ever called for plane==0, per spec #Coefficients syntax) -- it's
       `Mode_To_Txfm[UVMode]`, which for UVMode==DC_PRED is DCT_DCT
       (spot-checked against the spec's own Mode_To_Txfm table) and always
       `is_tx_type_in_set` (DCT_DCT is index 0, which is 1/true in every row
       of Tx_Type_In_Set_Intra) -- so chroma TxType is DCT_DCT with a
       *structural* zero-bit guarantee for this scope, exactly mirroring
       luma's TX_32X32 DCT_DCT guarantee, and needs no read-transform-type
       call at all (unlike luma, which does call it, itself a zero-bit
       forced read).

       CROSS-BLOCK CHROMA CONTEXT / MULTI-LEAF CHROMA (SCOPE BOUNDARY,
       updated -- multi-leaf-chroma extension, ADR-2607122000 Migration
       step 9 continuation): this namespace's chroma support is now
       validated for real MULTI-leaf color frames too, but ONLY for the
       simple \"one luma leaf -> one independent chroma block\"
       correspondence: every leaf's `mi-size` must be BLOCK_32X32 (this
       namespace's only supported luma leaf size, enforced independently by
       `tx-size-for` below) -- a BLOCK_32X32 luma leaf (bw4=bh4=8, never 1)
       always has HasChroma=true and subsamples (4:2:0) to exactly ONE
       BLOCK_16X16 chroma block, i.e. chroma block size is exactly half the
       luma leaf size in each dimension, a clean 1:1 correspondence. The AV1
       spec's \"shared chroma block\" case -- where a small luma partition
       (bw4==1 or bh4==1, i.e. below BLOCK_16X16-equivalent luma leaves)
       makes HasChroma false for some leaves so that MULTIPLE luma leaves
       share ONE chroma block -- is NOT implemented: `make-decode-block-fn`'s
       returned callback throws `:unsupported-shared-chroma-block` for any
       color-frame leaf whose `mi-size` isn't BLOCK_32X32, rather than
       silently mis-decoding (in practice this is unreachable today since
       `tx-size-for` already restricts every leaf, color or not, to
       BLOCK_32X32 via a different, non-chroma-specific reason
       (`:unsupported-tx-size`) -- this guard exists so the chroma-specific
       reason is explicit and this namespace fails safely even if a future
       change ever loosens `tx-size-for` on its own).

       The per-plane AboveDcContext/LeftDcContext/AboveLevelContext/
       LeftLevelContext maps (`record-above!`/`record-left!`/
       `get-dc-sign-ctx`/`get-txb-skip-ctx-chroma` below) ARE real map
       lookups keyed by absolute (subsampled) position, exactly mirroring
       luma's YModes/Skips/AboveDcContext/LeftDcContext pattern -- so
       threading them across multiple leaves needed NO new plumbing beyond
       lifting the old single-leaf-only guard: every chroma leaf's
       `decode-transform-block` call already derives its OWN chroma
       row/col/pixel-position from THAT leaf's own (luma) row/col (via
       `:subx`/`:suby` in `spec`), and the whole `state` map (including
       every per-plane context map and the persistent :u-plane/:v-plane
       pixel buffers) is threaded leaf-to-leaf by av1.tile-group's
       decode-partition the same way it always was for luma -- so a second
       leaf's chroma ctx now genuinely sees the first leaf's real
       AboveLevelContext/AboveDcContext, the same way luma's multi-leaf
       V_PRED/H_PRED fixtures already exercised for `y-modes`/`above-dc`/
       `left-dc`. The U (Cb) and V (Cr) planes are decoded with genuinely
       SHARED coefficient-CDF adaptation state (see `chroma-spec` below) --
       matching the spec exactly (`ptype` is \"luma vs chroma\", not \"Y vs
       U vs V\"; TileTxbSkipCdf/TileCoeffBaseCdf/etc. are single arrays
       adapted first by U's reads, then continued by V's reads, and now
       across every leaf in raster order too) -- but separate, per-plane
       AboveDcContext/LeftDcContext/AboveLevelContext/LeftLevelContext
       (spec: these ARE separately indexed by literal plane 1 vs 2);
     - luma-only frames (mono_chrome=1, num_planes=1) remain fully
       supported unchanged (all pre-existing monochrome fixtures/tests
       still validate identically -- `guard-frame-scope!`'s color-format
       check now accepts either monochrome OR 4:2:0, see below, and every
       chroma code path below is gated on `color?` so a monochrome frame
       never touches it);
     - segmentation / delta-Q / delta-LF / screen-content-tools / intra-BC
       must all be disabled at the frame level (`guard-frame-scope!` throws
       otherwise) -- each of those would need CDF tables/context derivation
       this phase doesn't implement (segment_id, delta_q_abs, delta_lf_abs,
       palette_mode_info, use_intrabc);
     - `read-cdef` and `filter_intra_mode_info`'s conditional-read GATE ARE
       implemented in full generality (not narrowed) since determining
       whether a bit *would* be read is cheap (a raw literal read and a
       single condition check respectively); `filter_intra_mode_info`'s
       gate correctly depends on the block's actual YMode (`YMode ==
       DC_PRED`, per spec) -- see `guard-no-filter-intra!` below -- but the
       CDF read *itself*, if the gate ever says a bit would be read,
       remains unsupported and throws (no `Default_Filter_Intra_Cdfs`
       table, see its docstring). `filter_intra_mode_info()` has no chroma
       equivalent in the spec (it's luma-only), so it's unaffected by the
       chroma extension.

   Everything above that throws does so via `ex-info` with a `:reason`
   key, matching the rest of this repo's out-of-scope-input handling
   (av1.frame-header, av1.tile-group).

   This namespace is wired into av1.tile-group/decode-partition via the
   injectable `:decode-block-fn` state key (see that namespace's
   docstring) -- `make-decode-block-fn` below builds that callback."

  "spec #Coefficients syntax coeffs(plane, startX, startY, txSz) --
   generalized over plane/tx-size via `spec` (see `luma-spec`/
   `chroma-spec` below): `:bwl`/`:w`/`:seg-eob`/`:scan` (tx-size shape),
   `:plane` (0/1/2, for the per-plane above-dc/left-dc/above-level/
   left-level maps), and the seven `:*-cdf-key`/`:*-table` pairs (which
   default-cdf table + adaptation-state key family to use -- luma's own
   vs. the shared-between-U-and-V chroma family, see namespace
   docstring). `txb-skip-ctx` is passed in already-computed (luma: always
   0, see `get-coeff-base-ctx`'s docstring; chroma:
   `get-txb-skip-ctx-chroma`) since it depends on state captured before
   this fn's own writes.

   `row`/`col` are the transform block's mi position in THIS PLANE's own
   4x4-unit coordinate space (== the leaf's luma row/col for plane 0; for
   chroma, luma row/col right-shifted by subsampling_x/y, see
   `decode-transform-block` below) and `mi-cols`/`mi-rows` this plane's own
   subsampled mi dimensions. Returns [eob quant state'] where `quant` is a
   flat row-major `seg-eob`-length vector (Quant[pos], signed, already
   de-scanned into raster position).

   `quant` is threaded as a plain persistent vector (not a transient) --
   segEob is small enough (<=1024) that this repo's usual
   simplicity-over-micro-optimization stance applies; every context lookup
   (get-coeff-base-ctx/get-coeff-br-ctx) needs read access to whatever has
   already been decoded into `quant` so far, which is simplest to express
   as \"the current persistent value\" rather than juggling transient
   checkpoints.

   `y-mode`/`base-q-idx`/`reduced-tx-set?` are only consulted for plane==0
   (transform_type()'s real cdf read, see read-transform-type) -- callers
   for plane>0 (chroma) still pass them through for signature uniformity
   but their values are never used (chroma's TxType is always :DCT_DCT via
   a different, read-free code path, see namespace docstring). Returns
   [eob quant tx-type state'] (tx-type added for the ADST extension --
   plane>0 and the all_zero==1 case always return :DCT_DCT, matching the
   spec's forced/no-op TxType assignments in those cases)."
