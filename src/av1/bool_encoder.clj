(ns av1.bool-encoder
  "AV1 'Symbol encoder' -- the structural inverse of av1.bool-decoder's
   Symbol decoder (spec 8.2, \"Parsing process for symbol decoder\"). The
   AV1 spec is decoder-only (like every codec spec this org has encoded
   for -- see kotoba-lang/org-iso-h264's own decode->encode note); there is
   no 'Symbol encoding process' section to transcribe. Instead this
   namespace ports the REAL, independently-implemented range encoder that
   actually produces AV1 bitstreams real encoders (aomenc/SVT-AV1) and
   real decoders (this repo, dav1d) agree on: libaom's `od_ec_enc_*`
   family (`aom_dsp/entenc.c`/`entenc.h`, AOMediaCodec/aom master, fetched
   2026-07-13) -- the encode-side counterpart of the same daala-derived
   range coder av1.bool-decoder implements the decode side of. This is
   analogous to how av1.transform's ADST work cross-checked against
   libaom's `av1_iadst4` as a second independent source -- here the
   'second source' IS the primary source, since there's no spec text on
   the encode side to transcribe from at all.

   CORRECTNESS ARGUMENT (not just 'looks similar to the decoder'): every
   per-symbol boundary computation below (`encode-symbol`'s u/v) was
   derived by algebraic inversion of av1.bool-decoder/read-symbol's own
   per-candidate boundary formula (`cur` in its search loop) -- assigning
   av1.bool-decoder's loop-local `n` (nsyms, `(dec (count cdf))`) the
   relationship `n == N+1` to libaom's `N = nsyms-1`, the boundary
   functions become IDENTICAL: decoder's `cur` at prospective symbol index
   `s` equals encoder's `v` (fh boundary) at that same `s`, and decoder's
   `prev` (`cur` from the s-1 iteration) equals encoder's `u` (fl
   boundary) -- see this namespace's `encode-symbol` docstring for the
   full derivation. This was verified computationally, not just by
   inspection, before this namespace was written: a real encoded AV1
   bitstream's `read_symbol` boundary values were probed at several
   (cdf, symbol) pairs and matched byte-for-byte against libaom's
   `od_ec_encode_q15`'s `u`/`v` at the same inputs.

   IMPLEMENTATION SIMPLIFICATION (bounded low, no periodic flush): the
   real libaom encoder keeps `enc->low` inside a 64-bit machine word by
   periodically flushing its top bits into the output buffer (with
   backward carry-propagation into already-flushed bytes) once `cnt`
   would exceed ~40 -- a performance/memory optimization for encoding
   megabyte-scale real video, not a correctness requirement. This repo's
   encode scope only ever produces a handful of bytes (a single 32x32
   keyframe's tile data), so `low`/`cnt` here are simply never flushed
   mid-stream -- `low` grows as a single persistent accumulator across
   every `encode-symbol`/`encode-bool` call, and od_ec_enc_done's real
   byte-extraction algorithm (`done`, below) runs exactly once at the very
   end. This produces IDENTICAL output to a real periodically-flushing
   encoder (the periodic flush only serializes already-committed high bits
   early; it doesn't change what those bits mathematically are), while
   avoiding the fragile carry-propagate-backward-into-the-output-buffer
   bookkeeping the real implementation needs purely to stay within 64 bits
   -- verified by exact byte-for-byte comparison against dav1d's
   independent decode of this repo's own encoded output (see
   test/av1/bool_encoder_test.clj and the round-trip tests in
   test/av1/encode_test.clj).

   PORTABILITY (JVM Clojure ONLY -- a deliberate, documented exception to
   this repo's usual `.cljc` convention, not an oversight): because
   `low`/`cnt` are never flushed, `low` grows into a true arbitrary-
   precision integer over the course of an encode (tens to low hundreds of
   bits for this repo's single-keyframe scope) -- `low` is threaded as a
   Clojure `bigint`, and every arithmetic op on it uses the auto-promoting
   `+'`/`*'`/`quot`/`rem` (never `bit-and`/`bit-shift-left`/etc., which
   Clojure does not support on `clojure.lang.BigInt` -- confirmed
   empirically, not assumed: `(bit-shift-left (bigint 1) 100)` throws
   `IllegalArgumentException`). `pow2`/`shift-right'`/`low-bits'` below
   reimplement exactly the shift/mask operations this fn needs via
   multiplication/`quot`/`rem`, which stay correct for both fixnums and
   bigints.

   This file is `.clj`, not `.cljc`, because `bigint`/`+'`/`*'` do not
   exist in ClojureScript's numeric tower at all (cljs numbers are plain
   JS doubles, with no arbitrary-precision integer type built into
   `cljs.core` -- confirmed via `clj-kondo`'s cljs analysis, which flags
   all three as unresolved symbols for a `.cljc` file, not merely a style
   nitpick). Per this repo's runtime-priority policy (kotoba wasm >
   clojurewasm > cljs > nbb > (jvm/bb), see `com-junkawasaki/root`
   CLAUDE.md), JVM is the last-resort choice for NEW app code -- this is
   that documented exception: a cljs-portable version would need to use
   `js/BigInt` (which DOES support correct arbitrary-precision bitwise ops
   natively in modern JS) instead of Clojure's `bigint`/`+'`/`*'`, a
   genuinely different implementation, out of scope for this repo's first
   AV1 encode pass -- flagged here for a future revisit rather than
   silently assumed portable or silently left as a `.cljc` file that
   would only ever compile correctly under `:clj`."

   probability up to and including symbol i, cdf[nsyms-1] == 1<<15,
   cdf[nsyms] is the adaptation counter -- i.e. this repo's `cdf` IS the
   spec's `cdf`, not libaom's `icdf` (`32768 - cdf`); `fl`/`fh` below
   convert to icdf terms inline instead of requiring a second, pre-negated
   table).

   DERIVATION (see namespace docstring): let `n = (dec (count cdf))`
   (nsyms, matching av1.bool-decoder/read-symbol's own local `n`) and
   `N = n - 1` (libaom's own `nsyms - 1`). av1.bool-decoder's read-symbol
   searches for the smallest `symbol` where `symbol-value < cur(symbol)`,
   with `cur(symbol) = ((symbol-range>>8) * (icdf(symbol)>>6) >> 1) +
   EC_MIN_PROB*(n-symbol-1)` -- literally libaom's `v` boundary
   (`EC_MIN_PROB*(N-sym)` with `sym=symbol`, and `n-symbol-1 == N-symbol`
   since `n=N+1`) evaluated at that same candidate index. The PREVIOUS
   iteration's `cur` (== decoder's `prev`, the boundary just before the
   found `symbol`) is therefore libaom's `u` boundary evaluated at
   `sym-1`. So: `u = cur(sym-1)`, `v = cur(sym)` -- both computed by the
   exact same formula, just at adjacent indices -- confirming `fl`/`fh`
   below (which are exactly `icdf(sym-1)`/`icdf(sym)`, i.e. `32768 -
   cdf[sym-1]`/`32768 - cdf[sym]`) reconstruct precisely the boundaries
   read-symbol's search loop would have found for this `sym`, with no
   search needed (the encoder already knows which symbol it's producing).

   Returns [cdf' enc'] -- `cdf'` is the (possibly) adapted cdf, matching
