(ns av1.bitwriter
  "MSB-first bit writer -- the exact structural inverse of av1.bitreader's
   descriptor primitives (AV1 Bitstream & Decoding Process Specification
   section 4 \"Descriptors\" / 8.1 \"Parsing process for f(n)\"). This
   repo's decode side (av1.bitreader) is transcribed straight from the
   spec's read-side pseudocode; the spec itself never defines an encode
   side (it is a decoder-only document, like every other bitstream spec
   this org has encoded for -- see kotoba-lang/org-iso-h264's own
   decode->encode derivation) -- so every fn here is derived by literally
   inverting av1.bitreader's own fn, one descriptor at a time, and
   cross-checked by round-tripping through av1.bitreader itself (see
   test/av1/bitwriter_test.clj): `(br/f (br/make-reader (to-bytes (f
   (make-writer) n v))) n)` must reproduce `v` for every descriptor.

   ENCODE scope (first AV1 encode support, ADR-2607122000 Migration step 9
   continuation -- 'AV1 encode side' task, 2026-07): only the descriptors
   this repo's narrow single-keyframe/single-BLOCK_32X32-leaf encode scope
   actually needs are exercised end-to-end (f/uvlc/le/leb128/su/ns/
   byte-alignment/to-bytes) -- all seven are implemented in full generality
   (mirroring av1.bitreader's own generality) since each is a small,
   self-contained inversion, not because every branch is exercised by a
   real encoded stream.

   State is a plain map `{:bits [...]}` -- a vector of 0/1 ints, MSB-first
   in write order -- so callers can thread it explicitly (no mutable
   atoms), exactly like av1.bitreader's reader map. This repo's encode
   scope only ever produces on the order of a few hundred bits (a single
   32x32 keyframe), so the O(1)-amortized-append persistent-vector
   representation is simplicity-over-micro-optimization, matching this
   repo's usual stance (see av1.transform's docstring for the same
   tradeoff rationale)."
