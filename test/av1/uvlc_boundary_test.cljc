(ns av1.uvlc-boundary-test
  "uvlc at the width where `(bit-shift-left 1 n)` stops meaning 2^n.

  `.cljc`, and reachable from `run-tests.cljs`, on purpose. Every source file
  in this repository is `.cljc` -- a claim that it runs on ClojureScript --
  and until 2026-08-25 every test was `.clj` and there was no ClojureScript
  runner, so the claim had never been executed (root ADR-2608730000).

  What it hid, measured under nbb on that date:

    (bit-shift-left 1 31)  => -2147483648   the sign bit, not 2^31
    (bit-shift-left 1 32)  => 1             the count is taken mod 32
    (bit-shift-left 1 33)  => 2

  so `av1.bitreader/uvlc`'s saturating value `(dec (bit-shift-left 1 32))`,
  which the spec defines as 2^32 - 1, was **0**; its `2^leading_zeros - 1`
  term went negative at 31 leading zeros; and `av1.bitwriter/uvlc`'s guard
  `(>= value (dec (bit-shift-left 1 32)))` read as `(>= value 0)`, so every
  encode threw. Nothing on the JVM could see any of it.

  `av1.bitreader-test`'s existing uvlc coverage stops at one leading zero,
  which is why none of this showed up there."
