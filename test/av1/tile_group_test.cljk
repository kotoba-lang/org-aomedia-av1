  "Validates av1.tile-group's tile_group_obu() entry + decode_partition()
   against two REAL SVT-AV1-encoded streams:

   - keyframe-256x192.obu: a 4x3 grid of 64x64 superblocks with real
     (testsrc2) content, so the encoder actually produces a mix of
     partition types, not just PARTITION_NONE. Validates: (a) the whole
     tile can be walked (every superblock's decode-partition call,
     recursing through real CDF tables / context derivation / the real
     bool-decoder) without throwing or running off the end of the buffer --
     see av1.tile-group's namespace docstring for exactly what \"without
     throwing\" does and doesn't prove, given decode_block() isn't
     implemented; (b) every one of the 10 spec partition types is
     structurally reachable through this implementation (sanity that the
     CDF-table wiring for W8/W16/W32/W64 -- W128 doesn't apply here, no
     128x128 superblocks in this fixture -- and the split_or_horz/
     split_or_vert derivation are all actually exercised, not dead code).

   - keyframe-32x32-split.obu: sized so MiRows == MiCols == 8, which forces
     decode_partition()'s top-level call to take the
     `!hasRows && !hasCols -> PARTITION_SPLIT` branch (spec #Decode
     partition syntax) with ZERO bits read -- a bit-exact, content-
     independent assertion (unlike the 256x192 tree shape, which past the
     first leaf is not bit-exact against the real stream; see the
     namespace docstring's correctness caveat)."
