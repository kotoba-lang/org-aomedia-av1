  "Validates av1.decode-block's decode_block() (mode_info/read_block_tx_size/
   residual/coeffs/dequantize/inverse-transform-2d/DC intra prediction)
   against TWO REAL aomenc-encoded 32x32 monochrome keyframes, comparing
   this repo's reconstructed luma plane bit-exactly against dav1d's
   independent decode of the same bitstream -- see av1.decode-block's
   namespace docstring for the exact scope this validates (single
   superblock / single BLOCK_32X32 leaf / TX_32X32 / DCT_DCT / DC_PRED /
   luma-only) and test/av1/fixtures.clj's docstrings for exactly how each
   fixture was generated and why it lands in that scope by construction
   (encoder flags disable every non-DC intra mode, every non-NONE/SPLIT
   partition type, CDEF/loop-filter/restoration, and TX_MODE_SELECT) rather
   than merely by observed probability.

   `keyframe-32x32-gradient` (eob=7, few nonzero coefficients) and
   `keyframe-32x32-busy` (eob=67, many more) exercise this namespace's
   coefficient-context derivation (get-coeff-base-ctx/get-coeff-br-ctx) and
   per-context CDF adaptation (av1.bool-decoder/read-symbol) at two very
   different coefficient densities within the same TX_32X32 block.

   `keyframe-64x64-vpred`/`keyframe-64x64-hpred` (Phase 1 mode-coverage
   extension, ADR-2607122000 Migration step 9 continuation) extend the
   above to real MULTI-leaf frames (2x2 grid of BLOCK_32X32 leaves) and
   V_PRED/H_PRED, exercising av1.decode-block's cross-block context
   tracking (YModes/Intra_Mode_Context via `read-y-mode`, AboveDcContext/
   LeftDcContext via `get-dc-sign-ctx`, footprint-wide grid writes via
   `record-footprint!`) for the first time -- see test/av1/fixtures.clj's
   docstrings for the content design and av1.decode-block's namespace
   docstring for the exact scope boundary.

   `keyframe-64x64-split16` (Migration step 9 continuation, real-partition
   scope-boundary regression) validates that when a real bitstream's
   decode_partition() recursion goes deeper than BLOCK_32X32 (forced via
   `--min-partition-size=16 --max-partition-size=16` to reach BLOCK_16X16),
   av1.decode-block's tx-size scope guard rejects it with ex-info against
   REAL encoded bits, rather than only in a synthetic/direct-table-lookup
   unit test -- see test/av1/fixtures.clj's docstring.

   `keyframe-64x64-paeth` (Migration step 9 continuation, PAETH_PRED
   mode-coverage extension) extends the DC/V/H_PRED luma mode set to also
   include PAETH_PRED (spec 7.11.2.2 \"Basic intra prediction process\") --
   see av1.decode-block/av1.intra-pred namespace docstrings' PAETH
   sections and test/av1/fixtures.clj's docstring for the additively-
   separable diagonal-ramp content design that makes a real aomenc encode
   genuinely choose PAETH_PRED (not merely DC_PRED) for two of the four
   BLOCK_32X32 leaves."
