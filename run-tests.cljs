  "The portable suites in this repository, run under nbb.

   All thirteen source files here are `.cljc`, which claims ClojureScript.
   Until 2026-08-25 every test was `.clj` and there was no ClojureScript
   runner, so nothing had ever executed that claim -- root ADR-2608730000.
   The first portable test written found `uvlc`'s saturating value coming out
   as 0 here and as 4294967295 on the JVM.

   The `.clj` suites are not listed and are not silently forgotten: they use
   `byte-array` and other JVM-only interop in their fixtures. Converting them
   is separate work, and until it is done this file covers less than
   `clojure -M:test` does -- which is why the JVM suite remains the primary
   gate and this is an addition to it, not a replacement.

   Anything added to `test/` as `.cljc` belongs in BOTH lists below; being
   required is not being run.

     nbb --classpath \"$(clojure -Spath -M:test)\" run-tests.cljs"
